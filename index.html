            <div class="scroll-object">I started watching friends only last year. I have seen my room-mates watching it
                and I used to think its not worth watching or it’s overrated.

                But once I started watching I understood it’s not.

                It can make you laugh at any point of time. It’s not necessary that you have to watch it in
                chronological order. But well if you watch in order, you will get some jokes and plots better.

                The plot is basically about 6 friends Monica, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross and Joey who share great
                bonds with one another. As the story progresses you get to watch few fall in love with each other, some
                get complicated.

                Joey is the foodie guy.

                Phoebe is the ditsy girl.

                Monica and Chandler are the ideal lovers.

                Ross and Rachel have theirs complicated.

                Ross was married earlier but divorces the women when he discovers she is a lesbian. But he maintains a
                healthy friendship with her which is great to watch.

                You also get to watch in later episodes the pregnancy of each women. Each is unconventional and breaks
                many stereotypes.

                Well, this is the story line, what’s interesting is the way this simple plot is developed and filled
                with humour and makes you laugh throughout the episode.

                The famous quote “You are my lobster” originated from this series !
